This is a React + Redux project that I will be updating as I follow along with the Pluralsight course [_Building Applications with React and Redux in ES6_](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/react-redux-react-router-es6) by [Cory House](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/author/cory-house).

This project strays somewhat from the course in terms of initial setup (I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and my personal code style and other preferences.
