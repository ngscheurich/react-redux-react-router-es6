# Building Applications with React and Redux in ES6

This is a React + Redux project that I will be updating as I follow along with the Pluralsight course [_Building Applications with React and Redux in ES6_](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/react-redux-react-router-es6) by [Cory House](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/author/cory-house).

This project strays somewhat from the course in terms of initial setup, visual design, and my personal preferences regarding code style. Some newer library versions are also used.
